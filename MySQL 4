MySQL 4: Summarizing data (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, TIMESTAMPDIFF)

-	All aggregate functions require you to enter either a column name or a "*" in the parentheses after the function word.


COUNT:
-	COUNT(*): Null values are included
COUNT(column name): Null values are excluded.

To count the total number of rows in the breed column:
  SELECT COUNT(breed)
  FROM dogs;

COUNT (column name)/DISTINCT:
-	Cannot use DISTINCT with COUNT(*)

To count the total number of indivdual dogs successfully completed at least one test:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Dog_Guid)
  FROM complete_tests;

SUM/ISNULL:
To count exactly how many null values:
  SELECT SUM(ISNULL(exclude))
  FROM dogs;

AVG, MIN, MAX:

  SELECT test_name, 
    AVG(rating) AS AVG_Rating, 
    MIN(rating) AS MIN_Rating, 
    MAX(rating) AS MAX_Rating
  FROM reviews
  WHERE test_name="Eye Contact Game";

TIMESTAMPDIFF:

To khow much time it took to complete each test provided in the exam_answers table, in minutes? Title the column that represents this data "Duration.":

  SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time) AS Duration
  FROM exam_answers

-	Instead of minute, it can be hour or second.
