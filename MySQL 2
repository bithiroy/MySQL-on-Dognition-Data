MySQL 2: Selecting specific data (WHERE, BETWEEN, AND, OR, IN, LIKE, DAYNAME/DAY, NULL)


WHERE:
  SELECT user_guid, free_start_user-
  FROM users
  WHERE free_start_user=1;

BETWEEN/AND:
to examine the Dog IDs of dogs who weighed between 10 and 50 pounds:
  SELECT dog_guid, weight
  FROM dogs
  WHERE weight BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

OR:
to examine the Dog IDs of dogs who were "fixed" (neutered) OR DNA tested:
  SELECT dog_guid, dog_fixed, dna_tested
  FROM dogs
  WHERE dog_fixed=1 OR dna_tested=1;

AND:
to examine the Dog IDs of dogs who were fixed but NOT DNA tested:
  SELECT dog_guid, dog_fixed, dna_tested
  FROM dogs
  WHERE dog_fixed=1 AND dna_tested!=1;

to look at data from dogs of the breed "Golden Retrievers.":
  SELECT dog_guid, breed
  FROM dogs
  WHERE breed='golden retriever';

IN to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause:
  SELECT dog_guid, breed
  FROM dogs
  WHERE breed IN ("golden retriever","poodle");

LIKE to specify a pattern that the textual data you query has to match:
to look at all the data from breeds whose names started with "s":
  SELECT dog_guid, breed
  FROM dogs
  WHERE breed LIKE ("s%");

•	WHERE breed LIKE ("s%") = the breed must start with "s", but can have any number of letters after the "s"
•	WHERE breed LIKE ("%s") = the breed must end with "s", but can have any number of letters before the "s"
•	WHERE breed LIKE ("%s%") = the breed must contain an "s" somewhere in its name, but can have any number of letters before or after the "s"

DAYNAME:
to know how many tests Dognition customers complete on different days of the week:
  SELECT dog_guid, created_at
  FROM complete_tests
  WHERE DAYNAME(created_at)="Tuesday";

to select all the Dog IDs and time stamps of tests completed after the 15 of every month with this command that extracts the "DAY" date part out of each time stamp:
  SELECT dog_guid, created_at
  FROM complete_tests
  WHERE DAY(created_at) > 15;

to select all the Dog IDs and time stamps of completed tests from after February 4, 2014:
  SELECT dog_guid, created_at
  FROM complete_tests
  WHERE created_at > '2014-02-04';

NULL:
to select only the rows that have non-null data:
  SELECT user_guid
  FROM users
  WHERE free_start_user IS NOT NULL;

to select only the rows that have null data so that you can examine if these rows share something else in Common:
  SELECT user_guid
  FROM users
  WHERE free_start_user IS NULL;

•	IS NULL will indicate rows of data that have null values.
•	IS NOT NULL will indicate rows that do not have null values.
