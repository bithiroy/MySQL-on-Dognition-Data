MySQL 1: Looking at data (SHOW, DESCRIBE, SELECT, FROM, LIMIT)


SHOW columns FROM tablename:
  SHOW columns
  FROM dogs

DESCRIBE tablename:
  DESCRIBE users

SELECT columnname FROM tablename:
  SELECT breed
  FROM dogs;

LIMIT to restrict the length of a query output:
Only see the first 5 rows of data:
  SELECT breed
  FROM dogs 
  LIMIT 5;

10 rows of data will be returned, starting at Row 6:
  SELECT breed
  FROM dogs 
  LIMIT 5, 10;

SELECT to query multiple columns:
  SELECT breed, breed_type, breed_group
  FROM dogs LIMIT 5, 10;

"wild card" (*) to return all the data in a table:
  SELECT *
  FROM dogs LIMIT 5, 10;
