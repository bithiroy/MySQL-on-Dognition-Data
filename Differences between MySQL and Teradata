In Teradata,
- HELP (i/o SHOW/DESCRIBE in MySQL) to get a list of columns in a table and information about a single column in a table.
- SHOW does something different in Teradata.
- TOP comes immediately after SELECT (i/o LIMIT at the end in MySQL).
- SAMPLE only in Teradata (not in MySQL).
- DISTINCT and TOP cannot be used together (while DISTINCT and LIMIT can be used in the same query in MySQL).
- Teradata accepts only single quotation mark (MySQL accepts both double and single quotation marks).
- To indicate “does not equal”, Teradata only accepts “<>” (MySQL accepts the symbols “!=” and “<>”).
- Date in the format of “YYYY-MM-DD”
- Teradata does not permit the use of IF statements, but it does permit the use of CASE statements. 
  Subqueries are run in Teradata the same way they are run in MySQL.
- Teradata provides the STDDEV_SAMP and STDDEV_SAMP functions (instead of the STDDEV function in MySQL).
